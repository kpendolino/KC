In the last year, I've gotten hooked on a new-to-me craft. Swedish weaving, also known as huck embroidery, first caught my attention years ago when I saw a cousin doing this very cool looking geometric embroidery on a throw blanket. I finally tried it over the summer of 2021 and discovered that it's fun, works up quickly, and produces stunning results. Take a look for yourself:

Swedish weaving is worked on a fabric with vertical "floats" on the surface of the fabric. A blunt tapestry or darning needle is used to pass colorful cord, yarn, embroidery floss, or ribbon underneath the floats. The yarn goes _between_ the warp and the weft of the weave, meaning that very little shows through to the back of the work. There are lots of great patterns out there, but if you're anything like me, you always want to tinker with the patterns. The patterns shown in the samplers above are mostly my variations on patterns I found online.

Since monk's cloth is closely related to the aida used for cross stitch, you may think - as I did - "what if I mix cross stitch and swedish weaving?" The short answer is _awesomeness results_. The slightly longer answer is _careful planning is needed, but you will get awesome results_.

When I get some time, I'll draw up charts for these patterns and share them. For now, though, please enjoy the photos ðŸ˜Š

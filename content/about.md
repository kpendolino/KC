## Welcome to Kendra Creates

Hi everyone!

I'm Kendra Pendolino (She/Her), and I like to make things. What I'm making on any given day could be a craft, a programming project, or a combination of the two - I'm a bit of a grab-bag. So welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I'll write about whatever little project is making my heart sing today.

Thanks for joining me ðŸ˜Š

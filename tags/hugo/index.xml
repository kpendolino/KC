Blackburn is a sleek, light theme and a great starting point, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t include support for dark themes out of the box. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how I added a dark theme to Kendra Creates.
Credit where credit is due - the code I wrote to add dark theme support is based on the process documented by Atanas Yonkov at Switching Off The Lights Part Two - Adding Dark Mode to Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Meet Hugo</title><link>https://kpendolino.github.io/KendraCreates/2022/03/27/meet_hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kpendolino.github.io/KendraCreates/2022/03/27/meet_hugo/</guid><description>When I first set up Kendra Creates, I went with the lowest barrier-to-entry: GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and a simple Jekyll theme. I made some changes and got everything set up, and quickly realized that I wanted something fuller featured. My husband, @dpendolino, recommended switching from Jekyll to Hugo to take full advantage of its features including post taxonomies and syntax highlighting. So I embarked on the process of switching to Hugo.</description></item></channel></rss>

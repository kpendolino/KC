Swedish weaving, also known as huck embroidery, first caught my attention years ago when I saw a cousin doing this very cool looking geometric embroidery on a throw blanket. I finally tried it over the summer of 2021 and discovered that it&amp;rsquo;s fun, works up quickly, and produces stunning results. Take a look for yourself:
Swedish weaving is worked on a fabric with vertical &amp;ldquo;floats&amp;rdquo; on the surface of the fabric.</description></item></channel></rss>
